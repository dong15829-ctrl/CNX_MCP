Prop,Prop,,,"A prop is a traffic variable used to track user behavior on a hit-level basis. It captures values that are tied to a specific interaction (such as a page load or click) and does not persist beyond that individual hit.

Unlike eVars, props are non-persistent and are not used for conversion attribution. Instead, they are ideal for understanding real-time behavior, page-level insights, or site structure analysis—such as identifying the page name, site section, or interaction at the exact moment it occurred.",-,"Props have a 100-byte limit in reports.

","All consents given (1 to 4): 'permit 1,2,3,4'
Consent given up to category 3: 'permit 1,2,3'

All optional consents declined (required only): 'permit 1 required'
In non-TrustArc markets (default): 'no consent' ","In non-TrustArc markets, 'no consent' is a default and should not be interpreted as actual rejection.

In some cases, ""permit ..."" values may appear for non-TrustArc regions if users previously visited a consent-enabled region and didn't clear cache.

In TrustArc markets, 'no consent' is recorded when there is no cookie value present. This can occur in situations where, even after consent has been initially given, the cookie is deleted—such as when the user manually clears their browser cookies or when an ad blocker deletes them.

*France: A Special Case
Unlike other EU countries, France allows AA data collection regardless of user consent due to local regulations and its specific TrustArc configuration.
In France, analytics tools are categorized under category 2 (Performance Cookies) instead of category 3.
To ensure consistency with other EU countries where only consented data is collected, the ""[FR] RGPD Consent Only"" segment was created.
This segment filters data to include only sessions where eVar94 or prop64 contains ""2"", indicating user consent for analytics based on the French TrustArc setup.
