- Persistence: The Visitor ID remains consistent across visits as long as the user’s browser retains the relevant cookies.
- Cookie Deletion Impact: If a user clears their cookies, a new ECID is generated, resulting in a new Visitor ID. In this case, Adobe Analytics treats the same user as a new visitor, and any previous tracking continuity is lost.
- Dependency on ECID: The Visitor ID (v63) is only populated if the ECID exists on the page. If the ECID is missing or improperly set (e.g., via a custom or non-standard implementation), the v63 value may not be collected.

","All consents given (1 to 4): 'permit 1,2,3,4'

All optional consents declined (required only): 'permit 1 required'
In non-TrustArc markets (default): 'no consent' ","In non-TrustArc markets, 'no consent' is a default and should not be interpreted as actual rejection.

In some cases, ""permit ..."" values may appear for non-TrustArc regions if users previously visited a consent-enabled region and didn't clear cache.

In TrustArc markets, 'no consent' is recorded when there is no cookie value present. This can occur in situations where, even after consent has been initially given, the cookie is deleted—such as when the user manually clears their browser cookies or when an ad blocker deletes them.

*France: A Special Case
Unlike other EU countries, France allows AA data collection regardless of user consent due to local regulations and its specific TrustArc configuration.
In France, analytics tools are categorized under category 2 (Performance Cookies) instead of category 3.
To ensure consistency with other EU countries where only consented data is collected, the ""[FR] RGPD Consent Only"" segment was created.
This segment filters data to include only sessions where eVar94 or prop64 contains ""2"", indicating user consent for analytics based on the French TrustArc setup.

India collects  ‘permit 1,2,3,4’ value due to legacy issues. Please review or exclude this data to ensure reporting accuracy.
