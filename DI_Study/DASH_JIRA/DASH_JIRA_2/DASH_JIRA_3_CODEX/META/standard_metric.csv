Site Content,Average page depth,No,"The ‘Average page depth’ metric shows how far a dimension item extends into a given visit, on average. For example, your Home page (which is a dimension item for the Page dimension) typically shows a smaller average page depth than your Purchase Confirmation page, which likely extends further into a visit.

Site Content,Page events,No,"The ‘Page events’ metric shows the number of times any link tracking call was made. This metric is helpful when you want to understand which pages have the most engaging content. Measurement for this metric is most valuable when a visitor can perform an action on the page without navigating to a new page.

For example, in a typical journey of an eCommerce site, a visitor can have several interactions on a single page. A typical Analytics implementation has these interactions configured as a link tracking (tl()) call, while a page view (t()) call is reserved for the initial page load. This implementation method provides enriched event tracking that provides insight around what interactions happen before a visitor continues their journey.",-,N/A,count(*) where post_page_event !=0,https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/components/metrics/page-events
